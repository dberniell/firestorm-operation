## PHPStorm integration

PHPSTORM has native integration with Docker compose. That's nice but will stop your php container after run the test scenario. That's not nice when using fpm. A solution could be use another container just for that purpose. But I don't want. For that reason I use ssh connection.

IMPORTANT

> ssh in the container it's ONLY for that reason, if you've ssh installed in your production container, you're doing it wrong... 

Use ssh remote connection.
